# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This homework I had a lot of trouble creating the future days part of the homework. I had found out that I need to have two api's working in tandem to get two different sets of data one for today and one for the next 5 days.
I learned a lot about how the api is supposed to work and what data it gives the coder to use in the code.
This application would be a great alternative to mostly any weather website.
